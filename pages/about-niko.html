    Hi. My name is Niko Skrypnik. I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world - Vancouver, BC very close
    to one of the most interesting plasces in the world - Seattle, WA. I'm a professional in software engineering with
    quite significant and broad experience in the industry. I've done developing of drivers for embedded systems,
    data management solutions for financial institutions, variaty of applications for mobile, embedded devices and desktops,
    web applications' back-end and front-end. Also my educational backgraound is quite unique as I studied computer science
    at the faculty famous for development of USSR R-36 ICBM system aka
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-36_(missile)" target="_blank">SS-18 Satan</a> (or rather infamous as back those times
    the name of the faculty and the fact that they were developing ICBM systems were kept in secret). So my background and
    very diverse experience shaped an unique vision about Software Engineering, technologies and life in general. I like
    to speculate deeply about things I'm dealing with at my job as well as in my life as I believe that thinking profoundly
    and critically about many aspects help you to understand things better regardless of is it just the work you're doing
    or it is any other phenomenon is happening around or in your life. So I have really deep and interesting thoughts about
    technologies as an engineering aspects, about economics, sociology and politics which shape our lives and give us the
    matter to apply our technologies to and I'm eager to share those thoughts and ideas to anyone who cares.
